						<h2>Overview of Tax Consultancy Services for Startups</h2>
						<p>Starting a new business requires adherence to local accounting rules, regulations and timely reporting. Due to the rapid changes in tax and accounting laws in India, startups may find it challenging to keep track of legislative updates and their application in tax filing and compliance.</p>
						<p>Ambiguity in understanding tax legislation has led to an increase in disagreements. Taxpayers now, more than ever, need guidance from specialists throughout the tax compliance process, given the tax authorities' closer scrutiny and management. </p>
