							<h2>Overview of Financial Modelling  for Startups</h2>
							<p>Financial modeling for startups is the process of projecting and forecasting revenue, customers, employees, costs, etc., for the future to understand, assess the profitability and viability of the business. Given that the startup is still in shape, this modeling will help prepare the budget and business plan for them and will help present that to potential investors. Furthermore, financial modeling enables startups to set realistic goals for revenue growth and profitability and also to monitor their performance against the financial plan by identifying areas of under-performance so that they can make necessary adjustments to their strategy to ensure long-term success and sustainability. Hence by creating a strong financial model, startups can have a bright and secure future for their business.</p>
