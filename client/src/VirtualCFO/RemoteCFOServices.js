						<h2>Overview of Remote CFO  Services</h2>
						<p>A Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is a senior member of a company's management team who oversees its finances, manages financial risk, produces financial reports, makes strategic choices and coaches/mentors start-ups and MSMEs. He is directly accountable to the organization's stakeholders. A remote CFO can advise you on progressive techniques to boost your organization's profitability and achieve your business goals.</p>
						<p>Businesses such as start-ups, Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) and other Small and Medium-Sized enterprises usually find it difficult to hire an in-house CFO due to a lack of resources. As a result, these businesses use remote CFO services to improve their performance. </p>
