							<h2>Overview of Limited Liability Partnership Registration in India</h2>
							<p>A Limited Liability Partnership or LLP is a type of partnership that combines the benefits of a regular partnership and a company. To create an LLP, at least two partners need to agree and sign a document called the LLP agreement. One advantage of an LLP is that the partners are not responsible in their personal capacity for the debts of the business beyond their investment. Also, similar to a company the LLP can continue to exist in case one of the partners leaves or dies.</p>
							<p>The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 governs processes related to Limited Liability Partnerships in India. At the least, two partners are needed to form an LLP and there is no upper limit on the number of partners. Two of the authorized partners must be natural people, with 1 of them being an Indian resident.</p>
                            <p>The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 governs how LLPs are registered and run in the country.</p>

							<h3>What Are the Benefits of LLP Registration?</h3>
							<p>Following are the merits of choosing to incorporate an LLP in India: </p>
							<ul style={{marginLeft:'10px'}}>
								<li>Separate legal entity :
                                    <p>
                                        Like corporations, LLPs are distinct legal entities. They can initiate lawsuits on behalf of the partners even though they are separate from them. In order to earn the trust of different stakeholders and inspire confidence in the firm among customers and suppliers, LLP contracts are executed in the name of the business.


                                    </p>
                                </li>
								<li>Partners are only partially liable :
                                    <p>
                                        In an LLP, each partner is only responsible for their own contributions i.e. they are only accountable for the contributions they made and are not personally liable for any losses the business suffers. The partners have no personal liabilities and therefore, they are free to conduct themselves as respectable businessmen.


                                    </p>
                                </li>
								<li>Lower incorporation costs :
                                    <p>An LLP's formation is less expensive than incorporating a public or private limited company. There are not many compliance obligations for the LLP. The LLP is only required to file Annual Returns and Solvency Statements each year.</p>
                                </li>
								<li>Easy transfer of ownership :<p>
                                    LLPs offer the advantage of easy ownership transfer, which sets them apart from other types of business entities. This is why individuals often choose to register as an LLP.
                                </p></li>
