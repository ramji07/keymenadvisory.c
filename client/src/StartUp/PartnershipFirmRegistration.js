						<h2>Overview of Partnership Firm Registration</h2>
						<p>The establishment of a partnership firm is a significant aspect of business organisation and is widely adopted in India. It requires a minimum of two individuals to form a partnership firm. Such firms are created when individuals collaborate to establish a business and distribute its profits among themselves based on a pre-agreed ratio. The scope of a partnership business encompasses various trades, occupations and professions.</p>
						<p>The operations and regulations of partnership firms in India are governed by the Indian Partnership Act of 1932. The individuals who come together to initiate a partnership firm are referred to as partners. The formation of the partnership firm is based on a contractual agreement among the partners, known as a partnership deed. This deed governs the relationships between the partners themselves and between the partners and the partnership firm.</p>
