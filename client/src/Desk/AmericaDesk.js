							<h2 > NRI Business Desk</h2>
							<p>The business opportunities in India have extensively increased creating an investment-friendly environment for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) considering the economic, demographic, geographical, and government initiatives taken in recent days. The Government of India took several economic reforms to attract foreign investment in India by offering facilities for NRIs in terms of investment benefits, tax benefits etc. However, the Income Tax Rules applicable to NRIs are different from those applicable to Resident Indians.</p>
							<p>NRI taxation in India is a constant matter of concern for the vast number of Indians living all over the world who have to send money home and make investment planning for themselves and their family. The concept of ‘Deemed Residency’ announced in the Finance Act 2020 has also created some ambiguity related to the residency of individuals and taxation of income in India. </p>

We have a dedicated team of professionals & experts who serve to NRIs on several matters. The detailed list of services being provided by ASC to NRIs is as under:
