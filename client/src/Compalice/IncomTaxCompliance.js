									<h2>Overview of Income Tax Compliances</h2>
									<p>In today's global business landscape, it has become essential to have a comprehensive understanding of tax and regulatory policies in order to maximise growth and capitalise on opportunities, especially with the increasing investment and transactions by multinational companies in India. Leading tax consultants and advisors in the country specialise in assisting businesses with income tax services and navigating the complexities of tax and regulatory procedures. As the world undergoes significant changes, India is also embracing a new approach to broaden its tax base and enforce stringent compliance measures using digital platforms</p>
									<p>Before formulating investment strategies, it is essential for companies to have a thorough understanding of the tax regulatory challenges they may face as they expand their business geographically or undergo structural changes. Companies are actively brainstorming to identify the most optimal tax structures and unlock potential opportunities. In pursuit of their organisational goals, companies often choose to outsource critical aspects of their tax strategy to ensure alignment between investments and tax management.</p>
