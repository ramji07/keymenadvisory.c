						<h3>What Are the Benefits of Private Limited Company Registration?</h3>
						<p>The benefits of private limited company in India are: </p>
						<ul style={{marginLeft:'10px'}}>
							<li>Separate Legal Entity :
								<p>
									A Private Limited Company is legally recognised as a distinct entity with its own rights and responsibilities. It is distinct from its directors in terms of assets and liabilities, functioning as a separate legal entity known as a "juristic person." The members of the company aren't personally liable for the debts and obligations, which helps in protection of their personal assets. This separation between management and ownership ensures that the company's managers are held accountable for its performance and any potential shortcomings or failures.


								</p>

							</li>
							<li>Minimum Capital Requirement :
								<p>
									There is no stipulated minimum capital requirement for the formation of a Private Limited Company in India. It can be registered with as low as Rs. 10,000 as the total authorized share capital.

								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Tax Efficiency :
								<p>
									Private Limited Companies benefit from tax efficiency as they are eligible for corporation tax relief on their profits. This helps in significant tax savings and increased profits. Additionally, dividends distributed by Private Limited Companies to shareholders are taxed at a lower rate.

								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Uninterrupted Existence :
								<p>
									As it is a separate legal entity, a Pvt. Company remains unaffected by changes in membership, such as the departure or demise of a member. Regardless of these changes, the company continues to exist independently.

								</p>
							</li>
