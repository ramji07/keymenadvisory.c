							<h3>
								Understanding the Meaning of Accounts Payable

							</h3>
							<p>Accounts payable is a major component of a company's financial management and represents the money owed by a business to its suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit. These outstanding obligations are recorded as a current liability on the company's balance sheet. Accounts payable include the total amount of approved but unpaid invoices from suppliers, reflecting the company's commitment to settle these invoices in the future. </p>
